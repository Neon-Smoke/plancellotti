						Peter’s story begins with a brief introduction of life in California at fifty-nine towards the end of the year 2020. The invasion of the dreaded Covid19 pandemic is in full force killing indiscriminately. Thinking back to the tragic death of a loved one and feeling unable to continue with life alone, he knows he must carry on with life. While processing traumas and tragedies he’s experienced, the story unfolds from his earliest memories.

						Peter realized he was gay at six yet didn’t know what to call it. Having his first sexual encounter extremely young, he believed homosexuality was acceptable by society based on his observation of his mother’s career. He later finds out the harsh realities of how the world judges people like himself as deviant.
						<br>
						Raised Catholic, Peter couldn’t abide by the dogmatic Church deeming homosexuality as sinfully unacceptable. His Catholic father, Lucas, born in Italy and coming from a family of seventeen brothers and sisters, thought God made a mistake with his son. Peter thought his father could never accept him or love him after coming out of the closet. To complicate matters, his father was an excommunicated Catholic having been divorced with five other children. He remarries Peter’s Canadian mother, Katherine. By marrying a divorcee, she also is excommunicated from the Catholic Church. Her search for a personal relationship with a higher power unexpectedly leads her to become an accredited psychic.
						<br>
						This starts Peter down a road of spiritual self-discovery forever changing him. Surrounded by the supernatural for most of his life, he has guidance from a Canadian cousin who has always loved him, even when his Italian family disowns him. Four special mentors he names also guide him on his spiritual path. He would have to make some hard decisions affecting his future when tragedies struck. Being aware that everybody has uncontrollable events affecting them negatively at times, he wonders if the power of positive thinking is enough for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Whether he accepts his spiritual destiny is a mystery he must solve.

						“Alive After Dying…” is a nonfiction account delving deeply into Peter’s past where mysteries come to light in unexpected ways. His self-deprecating and satirical observations often show a playful exploration of how he handles life’s seemingly insurmountable tests.<br>
						Most of us have experienced heartbreaking tragedies in love and health. Feelings of being judged with cruelty by our families, and societal biases from the world at large can be the bane of those who identify as LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning/queer). In part, due to the brainwashing power of religion, Peter believes in controlling our own actions instead of reacting to the world. To better create a sense of order out of chaos and power over our destinies, accepting change is a necessity. To pursue a spiritual path, it’s vital to help ourselves before we can help others reach their potential. He believes higher consciousness is a journey that may be the next step in human evolution. Can Peter change as he believes?

						<p style="text-align: center; padding-right: 2.5%; padding-bottom: 2.5%;"> Since Lancellotti has been educated in both science and religion, certain topics and theories discussed by people in the story may be considered blasphemous and shocking in the search for universal "truth" - not his truth, but the truth. Can such truth exist? His story presents the possibility.
