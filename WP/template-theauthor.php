							Growing up on the Massachusetts/Rhode Island borderline, Peter's undergraduate
							work took place for the first two years at the Community College of Rhode Island. He pursued a bachelor's degree in Communications with enough credits for a Music, English, or Philosophy minor. He chose Philosophy and graduated in 1984 while attending Rhode Island College for  the last two years of his undergraduate studies.
							<br>
							Of the many authors he's been influenced by, Peter found the works of
							Plato magnificent, especially <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/republic/" class="textlinks" target="_blank">The Republic</a> as the most interesting book describing humanity's psychological
							development and concepts of justice. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alice-A.-Bailey/e/B000APSJ4O%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share" target="_blank">Alice A. Bailey</a>, a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=definition+of+theosophy" target="_blank"><i>theosophist</i></a>, not to be confused with the study of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=definition+of+theology" target="_blank"><i>theology</i><a>, is a favorite influential author of Lancellotti, along with <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/spiritualism-science-and-the-mysterious-madame-blavatsky/" target="_blank">Helena Petrovna Blavatsky</a> who brought Theosophy, also known as the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=definition+of+the+occult" target="_blank"><i>occult</i></a>, to America in 1875 with Henry Steel Olcott. Having also studied theology, Peter held to the belief that no one religion had all the answers to the inner workings of the universe. He believed they all had contributions to “truth.” He felt popular religions pigeonholed us, limiting our views when thinking outside the box about the nature of God, the supernatural, and how it affects our personal relationship with a higher power.

							Other influential literature impacting his thoughts about the nature of humanity include <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emerson/" class="textlinks" target="_blank">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edgar-Allan-Poe" target="_blank">Edgar Allen Poe</a>, the poetry of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/walt-whitman-gay-new-textbook-rules-spark-lgbtq-history-n821636" target="_blank">Walt
							Whitman</a>, and one of Peter's favorite authors, <a href="https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/william-shakespeare/william-shakespeare-biography/" target="_blank"> William Shakespeare</a>. A few modern authors he's read and enjoyed include <a href="https://www.cslewis.com/us/" target="_blank">C.S. Lewis</a>, <a href="https://www.jkrowling.com/writing/" target="_blank">J.K. Rowling</a>, and <a href="https://www.madeleinelengle.com/madeleine-lengle/" target="_blank">Madeleine L’Engle</a> in the realm of fantasy, as well as <a href="http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_home_page.html" target="_blank">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="https://dunenovels.com/frank-herbert/" target="_blank">Frank Herbert</a>, and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-C-Clarke" target="_blank">Arthur C. Clarke</a> as these writers created worlds, which stimulated his own creativity. 
							<br>

							An author who fascinated him in the sphere of drama and screenplay writing, as well as being the first to introduce him to gay thought was the late great <a href="https://www.biography.com/writer/tennessee-williams" target="_blank">Tennessee Williams</a>. He was a brave gay man out of the closet at the time he lived, born in the early part of the 20th century, making a thorough examination about mortality in a variety of stage and screenplays. His dark view of homosexuality was colored by his own upbringing. As for Lancellotti's interest in immortality, <a href="http://annerice.com/" target="_blank">Ann Rice</a> examined the possibility of life as a vampire, exciting his macabre side. He’s read many other vampire novels, including one of the most famous, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bram-Stoker" target="_blank">Bram Stoker</a>'s “Dracula.”

							During his daily working life, after many years of experience in a variety of fields
							starting as an account executive at an ad agency, he eventually became an expert in sales and marketing. Beginning with an infomercial company, and then managing a sales team at an internet advertising start-up, he then acquired over 20 years of experience in telecommunications and Cable TV. In 2008 when the U.S. market crashed, Peter decided to reinvent himself. After discussing his next career move with friends and his husband, he reminisced over a	part-time job he had as the Recreational Director at the Institute of Mental Health in Cranston, Rhode Island. He worked with older adults, doing sing-alongs to piano and guitar. Lancellotti, a classically trained guitarist from the age of eight, was also a studio musician. In addition to working on his craft, he realized he enjoyed working with older adults.

							He was always attracted to older people in his life, surrounding himself with those
							smarter than he was because of his innate thirst for knowledge. His original reinvention plan was to make a simple transition from sales and marketing in Cable TV to telehealth. 
							<br>
							As a student of the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California, Peter worked in scientific research for over four years. Gerontology is the study of aging across the lifespan with an emphasis on older adults. He recruited older adults into a longitudinal study experimenting on the hypothesis of whether Alzheimer's was detectable with our current instrumentation. Peter was not only responsible for recruitment, but also administered cognitive testing.

						 	He was in demand by other professors having never worked half-heartedly and was recruited into four other studies he followed through to completion.
							After working as a research assistant, he decided he could help older
							adults in a better capacity by opening his own homecare agency in Los Angeles County. 

							He served the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning/Queer) older adult demographic, which surprisingly had never been done successfully.

							Here is when his career came to a screeching halt after developing comorbidities of his own at the end of 2016. 

							After experiencing personal tragedies and trauma beginning in April 2019, he isolated himself for a year and sought therapy. Then Covid19 hit the planet in March 2020. Being declared permanently disabled, this would be the beginning of Peter’s next chapter in life—writing.
