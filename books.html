		  	Peter is about to release a memoir tentatively named “ALIVE AFTER
			DYING: on being gay and spiritually challenged.” It’s not about life after death.
			Peter’s focus is to rise above the negativity and tragedies he’s experienced during his
			quest for spiritual enlightenment. Raised Catholic and disappointed in the Church with their
			dogmatic beliefs that homosexuality was sinful from early on in life, he strives to understand the
			nature of humanity both straight and gay. He sets out on a quest to demonstrate with his own
			hypothesis that a higher being, which many worship, is within ourselves and always has been.
			Having also studied gerontology and working as a scientist, he found no conflict between a belief
			in higher awareness and science.<br>
			<br>
			In his spiritual journey, he’s had guidance from four special mentors he discusses, yet
			realizes there may be more of them in his future. His mentors, one being a Jesuit, exposed him to
			studies that were far beyond the norm. All four mentors he names in the story were occult
			teachers, religious instructors, some that were within and outside of Christianity with none of
			them having traditional views. All of them exposed Peter to various theological and occult
			themes that will certainly upset the Roman Catholic Church. When we find out what happens to
			these mentors, some of it is extremely graphic and shocking.<br>
			In his attempt to understand Catholicism, it caused disparities early on in his life. There
			were complex relationships within his Italian family Peter tried to understand. The Canadian side
			of his family, being more accepting, had more secrets than he could have imagined.<br>
			The story arc progresses like a mystery novel the more we understand that Peter has a lot
			to hide and compartmentalize in his life. His life begins getting complicated and heats up a few
			years before graduating high school. Struggling with drug addiction, dealing with feelings that
			his father may never love him after finding out some of Peter’s secrets, the author realizes early
			on in life that it isn’t fair. Even his own gay friends find that the author’s discovery about his
			homosexuality is abnormal.<br>
			During his 26-year relationship with his husband, who passed away in 2019, “Alive After
			Dying…” is an account of tragedy, comedy, satire, an exploration in discovering gender identity
			and sexual orientation, along with life’s tests, which come in unexpected ways, the author takes
			us on a journey that is remarkable and terrifying at times.<br>
			All of his beta readers, except for one who is an author of fantasy and horror, have asked
			Peter “Is this story for real?” During the completion of his book, he showed a few of them a two-
			inch thick folder with documents, reports, genealogical information, signed permission slips, and
			newspapers articles from microfiche that prove everything in his story.<br>
