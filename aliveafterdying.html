				  		It is not about life after death.

						Peter’s story begins and ends in the year 2020 during the invasion of the dreaded
						Covid19 pandemic, killing indiscriminately. While being unable to fathom continuing
						with life alone after the death of someone close to him, he knows he must carry on for the
						sake of others. After a brief introduction about where he is now at the age of fifty-nine
						handling traumas and tragedies, the story unfolds from his earliest memories.
						<br>
						<br>
						The author discovered he was gay at an early age. Having his first sexual encounter
						unusually expedient in life and believing homosexuality was acceptable by society based
						on his mother’s career, he soon finds out the harsh realities of how the world judged
						people like himself as unacceptable and deviant.
						<br>
						<br>
						Raised Catholic, Peter couldn’t abide by the dogmatic Church deeming homosexuality as
						sinful. His Catholic father, born in Italy and coming from a family of seventeen brothers
						and sisters, thought God made a mistake with his son. Peter thought his father could
						never accept him or love him after coming out of the closet. To complicate matters, his
						father was an ex-communicated Catholic having been divorced with five other children.
						His father then remarried Peter’s Canadian mother, also an ex-Catholic who turns out to
						be an accredited psychic.
						<br>

						This starts Peter down a road of spiritual self-discovery forever changing him.
						Surrounded by the supernatural for most of his life, he has guidance from one cousin who
						has always loved him, even when his family disowns him. Four special mentors he names
						help guide him on his spiritual path, though at a great price. He would have to make
						decisions affecting his future leading to traumas and tragedies he would face. Whether he
						accepts his destiny is a mystery he must solve by his own choices in life.
						<br>
						<br>
						“Alive After Dying…” is a nonfiction account delving deeply into the author’s past
						where mysteries unravel tragedies, which come to light in expected ways. He writes his
						story with the savvy of an investigative reporter using satire and gut-wrenching mystery
						in an exploration of how he handles life’s seemingly insurmountable tests.
						<br>
						It is a story many can relate to who have experienced heartbreaking tragedy in love and
						health, being judged with cruelty by their families and the world at large and feeling like
						we don’t fit in because of the brainwashing powers of religion over the masses.
						<br>
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: center; padding-right: 2.5px; padding-bottom: 2.5%;"> Since the author has been educated in both science and religion, some subjects Lancellotti
						covers may be considered blasphemous and shocking if “truth” is to be uncovered – not
						his truth, but the truth.</p>
