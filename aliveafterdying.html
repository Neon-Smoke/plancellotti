				  	<p style="text-align: center; padding-right: 2.5px; padding-bottom: 2.5%;">
				  		Peter will be releasing in 2022 a memoir aptly named “ALIVE AFTER DYING: On being gay and spiritually challenged.”
						<br>
						<br>
						It is not about life after death.
						<br> 
					</p>

					<p style="text-align: left; padding-right: 2.5px; padding-bottom: 2.5%"> It's about Peter's focus to rise above the tragedy of losing his husband of 26 years to cancer during his continuous quest for spiritual enlightenment. Raised Catholic and disappointed in the Church due to its dogmatic beliefs that homosexuality is sinful, he sets out on a personal quest to find his own relationship with a higher power, a level of consciousness accepting all for who we are.

					<br>
					<br>

					During his spiritual journey, he has guidance from four special mentors he names, yet realizes there may be more of them in his future. In his attempt to understand Catholicism, he felt this branch of Christianity caused disparities in people’s lives. Peter has always been Surrounded by unexpected supernatural experiences throughout his life, and records them like an investigative reporter. 

					<br>
					<br>

					During his twenty-six-year relationship with his husband, who passed away in 2019, “Alive After Dying…” is a nonfiction account delving deeply into the author’s past involving
					tragedy, satire, and an exploration into discovering his sexual orientation as life threw tests at
					him in unexpected ways.

					norms, <br> some information may be unorthodox and shocking to readers.</p>
