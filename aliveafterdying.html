			  	<p style="text-align: center; padding-right: 2.5px; padding-bottom: 2.5%;">Peter will be releasing in 2022 a memoir aptly named “ALIVE AFTER DYING:
				On being gay and spiritually challenged.”

				<br>
				<br>
				It is not about life after death.
				<br> 
				<br>
					</p>

				<p style="text-align: left; padding-right: 2.5px; padding-bottom: 2.5%"> After feeling like a part of him died, Peter’s focus is to rise above the tragedy of losing his husband of twenty-six years to lung cancer during his continuous quest for spiritual enlightenment. Raised Catholic and disappointed in the Church due to its dogmatic beliefs that homosexuality is sinful, he sets out on a personal quest to find his own relationship with a higher power, a level of consciousness accepting all for who we are.

				<br>
				<br>

				During his spiritual journey, he has guidance from four special mentors he names, yet realizes there may be more of them in his future. In his attempt to understand Catholicism, he felt this branch of Christianity caused disparities in people’s lives. Surrounded by unexpected supernatural experiences throughout his life, and discovering that his mother becomes an accredited psychic much to their surprise, they have an unusual bond. 

				<br>
				<br>

				During his twenty-six-year relationship with his husband, who passed away in 2019, “Alive After Dying…” is a nonfiction account delving deeply into the author’s past involving
				tragedy, satire, and an exploration in discovering his sexual orientation as life throws its tests at
				him, which come in unexpected ways.

				<p style="text-align: center; padding-right: 2.5px; padding-bottom: 2.5%;"> Since Lancellotti covers subjects considered blasphemous and unacceptable by societal
				norms, <br> some scenes may be graphic and shocking to readers.</p>
