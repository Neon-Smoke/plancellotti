		<div class="about">
				<p> Growing up on the border of the Massachusetts/Rhode Island line, Peter’s undergraduate
				work took place for the first two years at the Community College of Rhode Island, pursuing a
				Bachelor’s Degree in Communications with enough credits for a Music, English, and Philosophy
				minor. He finished the last 2 years of his 4-year degree at Rhode Island College, choosing
				Philosophy as his minor graduating in 1984.
				After many years of experience in a variety of settings, he became an expert in sales and
				marketing. When he arrived in Los Angeles, he started at an ad agency, moving onto an
				infomercial company, and then an internet advertising start-up. He also has close to 20 years of
				experience in telecommunications and Cable TV.<br>
				<br>
				While working his way through college in New England, one of his favorite part-time
				jobs was as the Recreational Director at the Institute of Mental Health in Cranston, Rhode Island.
				He enjoyed working with older adults.
				Being a prolific reader, among his favorites were authors like the works of Plato—The
				Republic being one the most interesting, Alice A. Bailey who was a theosophist not to be
				confused with those studying theology, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky who brought Theosophy, also
				known as “the occult,” to America in 1875 with Henry Steel Olcott.<br>
				<br>
				Peter held to the belief that no one particular religion held all the answers to the secrets of
				the universe as they all had some contribution to “truth.” The author feels labels pigeonhole us,
				thereby, limiting ones views when thinking outside the box, especially when discussing the
				nature of God, the supernatural, and how it affected his upbringing as a gay man.<br>
				Other literature he’s read, forming his psychological and philosophical make-up included,
				Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allen Poe, Walt Whitman, and one of Peter’s favorite authors,
				William Shakespeare. Some of the more modern authors he’s read include C.S. Lewis, J.K.
				Rowling in the realm of fantasy, as well as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark as Peter felt these
				writers were the creators of modern science fiction.<br>
				<br>
				There was another author, which fascinated him in the genre of drama and screenplay
				writing. He was the late great Tennessee Williams, a gay man certainly out of the closet for the
				times he lived in, leaving us a thorough anthology about mortality and morality in a variety of
				screenplays. This caused quite a problem between him and his father. As his father discovered
				more and more about his son and second wife, he was convinced they were practicing the dark
				arts, which terrified him.<br>
				As for Peter Lancellotti’s interest in immortality, Ann Rice examined the possibility of
				what life as a vampire could have been like. Peter occasionally joked, saying, “My vampire
				missed his window since now, at 60 years old, if we don’t go back to looking like our sexiest
				self, I wouldn’t want to look 60 forever.” With the help of expert interpreters and continuing on
				the theme of immortality, Lancellotti has also studied Bibles predating the highly tampered with
				King James Version, which has close to 15,000 differences from the original Koine Greek,
				Hebrew, and Aramaic texts, including the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>
				<br>
				In 2008 when the U.S. market crashed, Peter decided to reinvent himself. During his
				reinvention in Los Angeles, his plan was to make a simple transition from sales and marketing in
				telecom to telehealth. While doing his graduate work in gerontology at the University of
				Southern California, which is the study of aging with his particular interest and emphasis on
				older adult cognition, Peter ended up working in scientific research for over four years.
				It was not what he expected, which was recruiting older adults into a longitudinal study to
				experiment with the hypothesis of whether or not Alzheimer’s was diagnostically possible with
				our current instrumentation. Peter was not only responsible for recruitment and informed
				consents, but also administering cognitive testing. With an exemplary work ethic, Peter was in
				demand by other professors who recruited him for four other studies, which he followed through
				to their completion.<br>
				<br>
				Over four years of being a research assistant, he decided that scientific research was
				something he hadn’t desired to do for the rest of his working life. He believed he could help
				older adults in a better capacity by opening his own home care agency in Los Angeles County
				serving the LGBTQ older adult demographic, which surprisingly, had never been done.<br>
				Here is where his career came to a screeching halt, developing comorbidities of his own
				at the end of 2016. So, he sold his agency. Unexpectedly, his mother, living on the east coast
				called in early 2017 to inform her only family and son, Peter, to help her. Unfortunately, later
				that year as he brought his mother’s situation almost under control, he also had to care for his
				husband of 26 years, whose health was failing and soon after lost him to lung cancer coupled
				with cardiomyopathy. No aggressive treatments, without killing him, were available. The only
				course of action was palliative care.<br>
				<br>
				As if the author hadn’t suffered enough tragedy, after waiting three years for his
				disability hearing, he had to appear in court literally the week after his husband died.
				Shortly thereafter is when the Covid19 pandemic hit the entire planet in early 2020. This
				would be the beginning of Peter’s next chapter in life—writing.</p>
